<h1>Calculator Application</h1>

<p>This is a simple yet comprehensive <strong>Java-based Calculator Application</strong> that performs a wide variety of mathematical operations. The application includes basic arithmetic, power, square root, factorial, and other common calculations, making it a versatile tool for everyday use. This project is built using <strong>Java</strong> and demonstrates key programming concepts like <strong>loops, method handling, and switch-case logic</strong> for user input.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Operations</strong>: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division</li>
    <li><strong>Modulus Operation</strong>: Calculates the remainder of two numbers</li>
    <li><strong>Power Calculation</strong>: Computes the result of one number raised to another</li>
    <li><strong>Square and Cube</strong>: Quickly calculate the square and cube of a number</li>
    <li><strong>Factorial</strong>: Determines the factorial of a given integer</li>
    <li><strong>Square Root</strong>: Finds the square root of a number</li>
    <li><strong>Percentage Calculation</strong>: Computes the percentage of one number in relation to another</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The application runs in a console environment, offering users a menu-based interface to select the desired operation. After selecting an operation, users provide the necessary input(s), and the result is displayed accordingly.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
